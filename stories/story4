As a user, I want to be able to save recipes to my profile so that I can easily find them later. When I find a recipe that I want to save, I should be able to click on a “Save” button and have the recipe saved to my list of saved recipes. If something goes wrong when trying to save a recipe, I should receive clear instructions on what went wrong and how to fix it. (ex. You need to log-in). I need to be able edit the list of my saved recipes by clicking “un-save” button. Within my saved recipes I should be able to sort them by different filters or by ingredients so I can easily access specific recipes when I need them.
