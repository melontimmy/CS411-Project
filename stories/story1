User Story 1 - Profile, Home, and Login 

Generally, I tend to view recipes on multiple devices - I like to look up new recipes on my phone when I’m on the train, but when I cook, I like to view my recipe on my tablet. I would like to store the recipes I find, and any ingredients that I might need in one place in the website so I can easily access them across multiple devices, preferably through something like a login. I also don’t like clicking through websites, so I would like everything I need like the recipes I saved and the ingredients I need to buy for recipes to be displayed in the home page. I also tend to change my mind often on the recipes I cook, so I need a way to remove recipes I no longer want to cook. I also tend to store a lot of recipes, so a way to sort the ingredients would be very helpful, even something simple like sorting from the region of the cuisine. Lastly, I would also like to keep track of the recipes I’ve already cooked.
