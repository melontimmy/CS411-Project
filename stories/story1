As a user, I want to be able to create a profile so that I can save my grocery/ingredients list and favorite recipes. When I create a profile, I should be able to add my basic information such as username, email, phone number, and password and be able to edit my profile information later if necessary. If something goes wrong during the registration, I should receive clear feedback on what went wrong and how to fix it. If I forget my username or password, I should be able to find them with either my phone number or email. If I click “I cooked this recipe”, it will automatically revise my ingredient list accordingly.
