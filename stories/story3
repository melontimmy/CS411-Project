As a user, I want to be able browse through a list of recipes with a dietary filter. Since there may be multiple dietary restrictions I need to consider, I want to be able to select more than one restriction to further filter out recipes. If I specify I would like to exclude a certain ingredient, I should have an option to be suggested recipes that allow me to swap out the ingredient for an alternative (for example swap out cowâ€™s milk for plant milk). I need to be able to save my dietary filters in case I want to easily search through recipes in the future.
