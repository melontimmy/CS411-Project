As a user, I want to be able to search for recipes based on ingredients/grocery items that I already have, so that I can save money by using what I already have (also I don’t have to waste food). If I don’t have enough ingredients to make a particular recipe, the website should provide me with a suggested recipe with the least additional grocery items needed. In addition, I should have the option to sort these suggested recipes by the price of the additional ingredients, and I should be able to filter out more expensive recipes based on a budget that I provide.
