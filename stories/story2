User Story 2 – Search by Ingredients Already in my Kitchen
I am a user that operates on a tight budget of what to cook each week, and am hoping to use the website for a larger variety of recipes to cook with ingredients I already have in my kitchen. I would like to have a tab on the website that includes recipes that use only these specified ingredients, which I’ve already saved in another tab (fridge tab). If some of the ingredients in my fridge go bad faster than others, I may want to prioritize using these ingredients before the others. The website should give me an additional option to let me select these ingredients and sort the displayed recipes in descending order of how many prioritized ingredients they include. If I don’t have enough ingredients to make a particular recipe, the website should provide me with a suggested recipe with the least additional grocery items needed. Some weeks I have a budget on how much more money I can spend on ingredients. In this case, I should have an option to specify my budget and sort these suggested recipes by the price of the additional ingredients, ultimately filtering out more expensive recipes that surpass my budget. Because I set aside a certain amount of money for food each week, this budget stays relatively the same, so I would also like an option to save the budget for future searches.
