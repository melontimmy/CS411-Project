User Story 5 – Keeping track of recipes and recipes
In order to keep track of what I have in my fridge, I would like to be able to list whatever ingredients I currently have on the website. However, I am not meticulous enough to list the quantities of ingredients, so it would be more convenient to simply state that I have this ingredient like a simple checklist. If I run out of an ingredient, I can simply go to my ingredient list, and delete it, or mark it as empty. I also want a way to organize my recipes. I want to be able to favorite recipes I use often, as well as store recipes to cook later, and mark recipes that I’ve cooked before, ideally all in one place.
