As a user, I want to be able to create a grocery list from the recipes that I saved so that I can easily purchase the necessary ingredients/groceries when I go grocery shopping(either online or offline). I want to be able to purchase missing ingredients directly from the website so that I don’t have to search for them elsewhere. When I view a recipe that I want to make but am missing an ingredient for, I should be able to click on a “Buy Missing Ingredient” button and be directed to a page with links to purchase those ingredients from a third party website(amazon fresh) with a new tab/browser.
