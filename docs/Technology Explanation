Project Assignment #3: Prototyping API calls

The technology stack we are demonstrating consists of Flask, which uses Python and HTML, along with SQL for our database. Flask is a powerful framework
that supports Javascript, and in general is a good fit for a web application. Other technology stacks such as Django seemed promising, but a few key
aspects led us to believe that Flask is a better fit for our purposes. For example, Flask incorporates general support for  RESTful APIs while Django
doesnâ€™t explicitly have it. As well, Flask is flexible and allows for more control over our application. In addition, two of the members of our team are
familiar with Flask and SQL from previous classwork, and we have several examples to reference for ease of development.
